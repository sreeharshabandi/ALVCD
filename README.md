Automatic License verification and Convict detection.
The conventional or the traditional way of collecting the toll from the vehicle owners or the drivers is to stop the car by the toll gate stations and then pay the amount to the toll collector in the toll booth, after which the gate is opened either mechanically or electronically for the driver to get through the toll station. 
This process takes a lot of time and no security authentication (i.e., Driving license verification) takes place. Due to the lack of License verification, many convicts, illegal license holder’s escapes. 
So, in order to stop all these problems and inconvenience, we introduce an automated way of collecting toll to reduce the time and verifying the Driving license through facial recognition, which helps the Police department to trace the convicts and illegal license holders easily. 

This project provides authentication using Face Recognition based on Oxford face API’s. Open and close commands of the gate are connected to face authentication and toll payment. User is said to be unauthenticated if he fails to have a valid Driving license. If the user is unauthenticated then a message containing his/her photo will be sent to the nearby police station.
